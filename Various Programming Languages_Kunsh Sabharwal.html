            <b><br/>1. C </b></h2></center>
        <p><br/>The C programming language is a procedural and general-purpose language that provides low-level access to system memory.
        A program written in C must be run through a C compiler to convert it into an executable that a computer can run. 
        Many versions of Unix-based operating systems (OSes) are written in C and it has been standardized as part of the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX).
        Today, the C programming language runs on many different hardware platforms and OSes such as Microsoft and Linux.
        Structured. It offers a structured programming approach for breaking down problems into smaller modules or functions that are easy to understand and modify.
    Portable - C is machine-independent and C programs can be executed on different machines.<br/></p>
    <br/>
    <ul></ul>
        <li><b>Mid-level programming language -</b> It's a mid-level language that supports the features of both a low-level and a high-level language. </li>
        <li><b>Rich library - </b>It offers numerous built-in library functions that expedite the development process.</li>
        <li><b>Dynamic memory allocation -</b> C supports the dynamic memory allocation feature, which can be used to free the 
            allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.</li>
        <li><b>Speed - </b>It's a compiler-based language, which makes the compilation and execution of code faster. 
            Since only essential and required features are included in C, it saves processing power and improves speed.</li>
        <li><b>Pointers - </b>C uses pointers, which improve performance by enabling direct interaction with the system memory.</li>
        <li><b>Recursion -</b> C enables developers to backtrack by providing code reusability for every function.</li>
        <li><b>Extensible - </b>A C program can be easily extended. If code is already written, new features and functionalities can be added 
            to it with minor alterations.</li>
    </ul>

        <p><br/>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm.
            It is an imperative and a compiled language.<br/></p>
            <p>C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for system and application programming.<br/>
            It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language. <br/>
            C++ is an object-oriented, multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and generic programming styles.<br/>
            One of the key features of C++ is its ability to support low-level, system-level programming, making it suitable 
            for developing operating systems, device drivers, and other system software.
            At the same time, C++ also provides a rich set of libraries and features for high-level application programming, 
            making it a popular choice for developing desktop applications, video games, and other complex applications.<br/>
            C++ has a large, active community of developers and users, and a wealth of resources and tools available for 
            learning and using the language. 
            <br/>
            <br/>Some of the key features of C++ include:
            <br/>
            <ul></ul>
                <li><b>Object-Oriented Programming:</b> C++ supports object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create classes and 
                    objects and to define methods and properties for these objects.<br/></li>
                <li><b>Templates:</b> C++ templates allow developers to write generic code that can work with any data type, 
                    making it easier to write reusable and flexible code.<br/></li>
                <li><b>Standard Template Library (STL):</b> The STL provides a wide range of containers and algorithms for 
                    working with data, making it easier to write efficient and effective code.<br/></li>
                <li><b>Exception Handling:</b> C++ provides robust exception handling capabilities, making it easier to 
                    write code that can handle errors and unexpected situations.<br/></li>

        <center><h2 id="hd1"><b> <br/>6. CSS</b></h2></center>
        <p><br/>CSS stands for Cascading style sheets. It describes to the user how to display HTML elements on the screen in a proper format. 
            CSS is the language that is used to style HTML documents. 
            In simple words, cascading style sheets are a language used to simplify the process of making a webpage.
            CSS is used to handle some parts of the webpage.
            With the help of CSS, we can control the colour of text and style of fonts, and we can control the spacing between the paragraph and many more things. 
            CSS is easy to understand but provides strong control on the Html documents.
            CSS is combined with HTML.<br/>
            Some advantages of using CSS include:-</p>
            <br/>
            <ul></ul>
                <li><b>Faster page speed:</b>It has a faster page speed than other code's page speeds. 
                With the help of the CSS rule, we can apply it to all occurrences of certain tags in HTML documents.</li>
                <li><b>Better user experience:</b>CSS makes a webpage very attractive to the eyes.
                Also, CSS makes it user-friendly.
                When the button or text is in a proper format, it improves the user experience.</li>
                <li><b>Quicker Development time:</b>With the help of CSS, we can specify the format and style the multiple pages into one code string.
                In cascading style sheet, we can make a duplicate copy of several website pages.
                If we make a webpage, it has the same formatting, looks, and feel, 
                so with the help of the CSS rule for one page, and it is sufficient for all the pages.</li>
                <li><b>Easy Formatting changes:</b>In CSS, if we need to make changes in the format, it is very easy;
                we only need to change the one-page format it will automatically apply to the other pages of CSS.
                There is no need to correct individual pages in a CSS style sheet.
                If we fix a CSS style sheet, it will automatically update the other CSS style sheet.</li>
                <li><b>Compatibility:</b>Compatibility is very important in today's age.
                If we create any webpage, it should be very responsive and user-friendly.
                 CSS is used with Html to make webpage design responsive.</li>
            </ul>

        <p><br/>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. 
            It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. 
            It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.
            JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). 
            JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. 
            JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. 
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of 
            language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Some features of JavaScript include:-</p>
            <ul></ul>
            <li>JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. 
                Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.</li>
            <li>Functions in JS are objects. 
                They may have properties and methods just like other objects. 
                They can be passed as arguments in other functions.</li>
            <li>Can handle date and time.</li>
            <li>Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML.</li>
            <li>No compiler is needed.</li>
